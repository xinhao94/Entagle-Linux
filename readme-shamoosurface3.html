<h4>Compiling ENTANGLE</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>
The ENTANGLE source archive contains all the data, configuration files, and 
source code required to run ENTANGLE. The ENTANGLE source tree is written 
entirely in Java and can be compiled and run with the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">J2SE 5.0</a>. In all likelihood, 
it has little dependency to the newest version of the Java environment and 
can be run with an earlier version of the environment.
</p>

<h5>Dependencies</h5>
<p>
ENTANGLE depends on two external libraries not included in J2SE 5.0, 
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/">Java3d</a> and 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/crimson/">Apache's Crimson XML Parser</a>. The 
jar file for the Crimson project has been included in the source archive. The 
Java3d project includes installers for various platforms and it is assumed in 
the ANT build script that Java3d is installed as an extension to the JRE (Java 
Runtime Environment).
</p>

<h5>Simple Compilation Instructions</h5>
<p>
These compilation instructions are intended for those familiar with how to 
execute operating systems and compiling Java programs in general. There are two 
ways to compile the ENTANGLE source:

<ol>
	<li><strong>Recommended:</strong> With the 
	<a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant Apache</a> build utility installed, 
	enter the ENTANGLE base directory with your favorite shell/command prompt.
	The 'src' folder should be listed in the current directory. Execute the 
	command 'ant'. This will execute the default ant build script, "build.xml"
	which will compile the java sources and output the class files
	into the 'bin' folder.</li>
	<li>Within a command prompt/shell of your environment, enter the ENTANGLE 
	base directory. The 'src' folder should be listed in the current directory 
	contents. Execute the 'javac' command for every java file in the 'src' folder
	</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Running ENTANGLE</h4>
<p>
ENTANGLE has 4 main entry points, classes with main methods. Simply execute
these class files from within your favorite command prompt/shell, e.g. 
"java -classpath lib/crimson.jar entangle.EntryClass". These classes
assume the working directory is the base ENTANGLE directory. The non-gui classes
require arguments or input files to process. These non-gui classes were used by 
the authors of ENTANGLE to compile the protein-nucleic acid interaction
databases.
<br/>
<ol>
<li>entangle.EntryClass - entry point to the GUI application</li>
<li>entangle.GeneralizedBaseInteractionProcessor - command-line application 
which takes as input a list of PDB files, or PDB ids, (separated by new lines)
and generates RIBBONS input files that display an aggregrated view of all protein-nucleic acid 
interactions oriented with respect to each of the nucleic acid residues </li>
<li>entangle.PDBProcessor - command-line application which takes as input
a list of PDB files, or PDB ids, (separated by new lines) and generates an XML 
document including all protein-nucleic acid interactions identified by the 
ENTANGLE program. </li>
<li>entangle.utils.PNDatabaseMaker - command-line application which uses JDBC
to create a database of interactions from XML documents generated by 
entangle.PDBProcessor. It is currently hardcoded to use an ODBC connection by
using the url, "jdbc:odbc:Protein-RNA Interactions".</li>
</ol>
